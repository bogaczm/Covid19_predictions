'Covid-19 Project'

To run the code properly one must only open the notebook and run all cells.
The code was prepared to run smoothly, the last regression done on the largest data set with 
5 epochs might take around 6h of training. The training on largest dataset with only 1 epoch takes 
around 2h, so it is advisible to comment out the whole section of world-based analysis and look on 
prerendered charts and plots. (this code is commented in the final version of the program)
